As someone who would like to work within Asset Management, I found that an Elite Boutique Bank would be what I prefer over the other types of investment banks as they offer more specific services. It was also great to hear the different career opportunities, and the core values and skills required to best match the role of an investment banker. Fortunately, investment bankers are mainly young, being between 20-30 years of age, which is a great benefit."
