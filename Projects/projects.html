                                    <p class="card-text">This project solves a huge problem at Micheldever. As a warehouse operative, you have to get tyres from specific locations and put them where the vans will be loaded. However if we can't find the tyre, we would have to report it to stock operatives. The issue lies where the stock do not communicate whether the tyre has been found or not which creates delays. This allows the stock operatives to post the short stock so we can check as we are loading vans to know for certain what should and shouldn't be there.</p>
